<p>	If a tomato could do anything
<br>	What would it do?
<br>	Would it stand the test of time?
<br>	Would it grow up up up
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Instead of out</p>
<p>	Should it care what others thought
<br>	Should it keep on keeping on 
<br>	without the slightest start </p>
<p>	I don't know what a tomato can do
<br>	If I did perhaps I would know
<br>	What a tomato could do
