<p>	If a tomato could do anything
<br>	What would it do?
<br>	Would it stand the test of time?
<br>	Would it grow up up up
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Instead of out</p>
<p>	Should it care what others thought
<br>	Should it keep on keeping on 
<br>	without the slightest start </p>
<p>	I don't know what a tomato can do
<br>	If I did perhaps I would know
<br>	What a tomato could do</p>

  From where does Temperance arrive?
  In her black suit and latte in hand
  As if deployed from above,
  Impossibly light in shoes
  impossible for mortal women
  Looking down at you
  Then back to your crown
  Her face hardening with the slightest hint of a curl of her lip
  She walks past without breaking stride
